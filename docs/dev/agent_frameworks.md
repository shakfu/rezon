# Agent Framework Evaluation: Rig vs AutoAgents

Evaluation of Rust LLM/agent frameworks for rezon, given that agents,
tools, and RAG are on the eventual roadmap.

## Current rezon stack (baseline)

- `async-openai` driving all 4 cloud providers via OpenAI-compatible
  endpoints (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, "other")
- `llama-cpp-2` with a hand-rolled worker thread, KV-cache reuse, and
  careful Metal teardown to avoid `__cxa_finalize` / `GGML_ASSERT`
  crashes during static destruction
- Streaming via Tauri events (`chat-token`, `chat-stats`, `chat-done`)
- ~753 lines in `src-tauri/src/llm.rs`
- No tools, no RAG, no agents today

## Side-by-side

| Dimension | Rig | AutoAgents |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud providers | 20+ | ~10 (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Groq, xAI, Google, Azure, DeepSeek, MiniMax, Phind) |
| Local: llama.cpp/GGUF | No | Yes - CPU/CUDA/Metal/Vulkan variants |
| Local: Ollama | Via OpenAI-compat | Native, plus Mistral-rs |
| Vector stores | 10+ (Mongo, LanceDB, Neo4j, Qdrant, SQLite, SurrealDB, Milvus, ScyllaDB, ...) | Qdrant only |
| Tools | Trait-based | Derive-macro typed tools + WASM sandbox runtime |
| Multi-agent | Agent workflows, multi-turn streaming | Typed pub/sub orchestration |
| RAG | Strong, many backends | Thin (Qdrant) |
| WASM (frontend) | Core is WASM-compatible | Not advertised |
| Maturity | Established, larger community | v0.3.7 (~Mar 2026), 623 stars, breaking changes likely |

## Analysis

### Rig

Strengths:
- Largest provider catalog and vector-store ecosystem in Rust
- Native Anthropic client unlocks features the OpenAI-compat shim hides
  (prompt caching control, extended thinking, citations)
- Mature, well-documented, broader community

Weaknesses for rezon:
- No llama.cpp / GGUF support. The most carefully engineered part of
  rezon's backend (worker thread, KV-cache reuse, Metal teardown) gets
  zero help.
- Adopting rig means two paradigms side-by-side: rig for cloud, custom
  for local. Tools/agents/RAG would only work on cloud unless we
  implement rig's `CompletionModel` trait over the local worker
  ourselves.

### AutoAgents

Strengths:
- First-class llama.cpp + Metal support maps directly onto rezon's
  existing local stack
- Same cloud providers we already use (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter)
- WASM-sandboxed tool runtime is a genuinely interesting fit for a
  desktop app that should not run arbitrary tool code in-process
- Typed pub/sub multi-agent orchestration

Weaknesses:
- v0.3.x: expect breaking changes, fewer answers in the wild, occasional
  need to PR upstream
- Vector-store story is thin (Qdrant only) - weaker if RAG breadth
  matters
- Smaller community

## Tradeoff summary

- **AutoAgents wins** if multi-agent orchestration, local/cloud parity
  for agents and tools, and tool sandboxing matter. Cost: early-adopter
  tax on a v0.3 framework.
- **Rig wins** if RAG breadth and a wider vector-store choice matter,
  and we are willing to keep `llama-cpp-2` as a separate path that does
  not participate in agents/tools (or write a `CompletionModel` bridge
  ourselves).

## Failure modes to test before committing

1. **AutoAgents' llama.cpp wrapper teardown.** Our current code exists
   *because* of `GGML_ASSERT` crashes during static destruction on
   Metal. Verify their wrapper drops the `LlamaContext` before the
   backend, or we end up back where we started.
2. **AutoAgents' streaming surface.** The UI consumes per-token deltas
   plus `chat-stats` (prompt/cached/gen tokens). Confirm their streaming
   abstraction exposes provider-specific token counts, or the stats
   panel regresses.
3. **Rig's local story.** If we go rig, prototype the `CompletionModel`
   impl over the local worker first - that is the load-bearing piece,
   and if it is awkward, the rest of the plan is awkward.

## Recommendation

Given that rezon is already a llama.cpp + Metal app and we want agents,
tools, and RAG eventually, **AutoAgents is the more structurally
appropriate bet** - but only if we accept the v0.3 maturity cost.

A third option worth naming explicitly: **defer the framework decision.**
Add tool-calling against the existing `async-openai` path as a small,
contained feature first. Once we know what we actually need from a
framework, the rig vs AutoAgents call becomes much easier to make on
evidence rather than speculation.

## Open questions

- How tightly does AutoAgents' llama.cpp binding handle Metal teardown?
  (Needs source-level verification.)
- Does AutoAgents' streaming surface expose `cached_tokens` for
  Anthropic/OpenAI prompt caching?
- For rig: how large is the lift to implement `CompletionModel` over the
  existing local worker?
- What is the realistic timeline for tools/RAG in rezon? If it is "next
  feature," integrate now. If it is "someday," defer.
