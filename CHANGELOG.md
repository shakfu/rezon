## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Wikilink expansion in chat + system prompts** (`crates/rezon-core/src/wikilink.rs`).
  Read-only `[[Target]]` / `[[Folder/Target]]` / `[[Target|Alias]]` markers
  in user messages and the system prompt resolve against the active vault
  via `vault_resolve_wikilink`, and the resolved note bodies are appended
  to the message as a `<context>\n## <rel path>\n…\n</context>` block.
  Stored conversation keeps the raw markers (so `/history` reads naturally
  and edits re-resolve next turn); expansion happens only at the send
  boundary and only on the system + most-recent user turn so prompt
  caching survives prior turns. Unresolved targets surface as
  `UiEvent::Error` in the TUI and a `chat-warning` Tauri event for the
  frontend. Eight unit tests (`scan_*`, `expand_*`).
- **Vault-write agent tools** (`crates/rezon-core/src/agent/tools/write_note.rs`):
  `write_note(path, content, overwrite=false)`, `append_note(path,
  content, create_if_missing=false)`, `edit_note(path, find, replace)`,
  `undo_note()`. All four gate on user confirmation, path-normalize
  (strip leading `/`, reject `..`, auto-append `.md`), call
  `vault_index_touch` so changes are searchable immediately, and report
  the journal outcome (entry id + git_committed + warning?) in their
  return payload. `edit_note`'s `find` must match exactly once — 0 or
  N≥2 matches error with a hint to pass a longer / more specific
  snippet. Registered together via `register_write_note(reg, search)`
  alongside `search_notes` when a vault is open.
- **`Tool::preview` method** (`crates/rezon-core/src/agent/tool.rs`).
  Optional `fn preview(&self, args: &Value) -> Option<String>` returning
  a diff-shaped string (`+ ` add lines, `- ` remove lines, anything
  else context). Agent loop computes the preview once per call from the
  registry + parsed args, then passes `Option<&str>` into
  `ConfirmationGate::ask`. TUI prompt and Tauri `agent-tool-confirm`
  event both surface it; UIs render the preview in place of raw
  arguments JSON when present. `WriteNote`/`AppendNote`/`EditNote`/
  `UndoNote` all override it.
- **Edit journal + git versioning** (`crates/rezon-core/src/journal.rs`).
  Append-only `<vault>/.rezon-history/log.jsonl` records every mutation
  (write / undo) with sha256 before+after pointers; content snapshots
  live deduped in `<vault>/.rezon-history/blobs/<sha>`. After each
  successful record, opportunistic `git add <file> .gitignore && git
  commit -q -m "rezon: <tool> <rel_path>"` against the vault's git repo
  (auto-`git init`'d if missing). `.rezon-history/` is added to
  `.gitignore` on first write so the journal stays out of the user's
  git log. Hook + signing config respected; failures are non-fatal and
  surface via `JournalOutcome::git_warning`. `last_undoable(vault)`
  walks the log skipping any entry already targeted by a subsequent
  `Op::Undo`. Eight unit tests covering record, dedup, gitignore
  idempotency, GC, and skip-git.
- **`.rezon-skip-git` sentinel** — touch `<vault>/.rezon-skip-git` to
  opt this vault out of the git auto-init/auto-commit (journal still
  records). Useful for vaults nested inside an outer repo where rezon
  shouldn't create a second one. Silent skip — no warning when the
  sentinel is present.
- **Journal GC** — `journal::gc(vault_root, max_entries)` keeps the
  most-recent N entries (default 500), atomically rewrites `log.jsonl`
  via temp+rename, then prunes any blob no surviving entry references.
  Triggered automatically at the end of every `record_write` /
  `record_undo`; failures are non-fatal.
- **`undo_note` agent tool + `/undo` TUI command + `vault_undo` Tauri
  command**. All three revert the most-recent journaled mutation:
  `undo_note` is agent-callable (confirmation-gated, with a diff
  preview); `/undo` is the user-direct entry point in the REPL;
  `vault_undo` is exposed to the frontend (returns `{ path, targetId }`
  on success). Each appends a new `Op::Undo` entry so the chain is
  walkable.
- **First-launch setup wizard** (`crates/rezon-tui/src/setup.rs`) and
  `/setup` command. On first launch (or whenever required fields are
  missing in `conversations.json`), prompts via rustyline for:
  models dir, vault dir, output dir, and default provider. Each prompt
  pre-fills the current value as editable text (`readline_with_initial`)
  — `<enter>` accepts, edit-in-place changes, empty input clears,
  ctrl-c aborts. Path prompts wire in `FilenameCompleter`; provider
  prompt completes from the static word list (local / openai /
  anthropic / openrouter / other). Wizard fires when
  `setup_complete: bool` is false; `/setup` re-runs on demand.
  Defaults follow env vars (`REZON_{MODELS,VAULT,OUTPUT}_DIR`,
  `REZON_PROVIDER`) when set, otherwise fall back to
  `~/Documents/Rezon/{models,vault,exports}` for the three path
  fields. Persisted in `StoreFile` as `setup_complete`, `models_dir`,
  `output_dir`, `default_provider` (all `#[serde(default)]` so
  upgrades are silent).
- **Slash-command pickers**. `/provider` and `/model` (no args) open
  the embedded fuzzy picker. `/provider` lists `local` + every cloud
  provider key from `models.json` with the current marked `*`;
  selecting clears the per-conv model override so the new provider's
  default kicks in. `/model` lists the current provider's
  recommended models for cloud, or scans the configured models dir
  for `*.gguf` files when provider is `local` — the picker
  load-and-set on selection via `spinner::with_spinner`. `/models`
  (no args) defaults to listing the current provider's catalog
  rather than first asking which provider.
- **`/export` honors `output_dir`** — bare filename goes there;
  empty arg auto-names from the conversation title under the
  configured output dir. Absolute or slash-containing paths still
  pass through. Parent dirs created as needed.
- **`last_local_model` auto-load**. On startup, when provider is
  `local` and neither `--gguf` nor `--model <path>` was passed, the
  TUI falls back to `rezon_core::llm::read_last_model(<config_dir>)`
  (the same helper the web app already used). Every successful local
  load — at startup, via `/load`, or via the `/model` picker — calls
  `persist_last_model` so the next launch resumes the same GGUF.
- **Diff-preview rendering in the confirmation surface**. The TUI's
  `prompt_yes_no` runs the preview through `colorize_diff` (`+ `
  lines green, `- ` red) and lets the y/N prompt sit right below.
  Frontend (`src/App.tsx`) gains a `DiffPreview` component that
  renders the same convention in the `ConfirmToolDialog` modal —
  `bg-success/10 text-success` for `+ `, `bg-danger/10 text-danger`
  for `- `, monospace block matching the existing argument-render
  styling. New `--color-success` / `--color-warning` CSS variables
  (dark + light), surfaced as Tailwind tokens.
- **`chat-warning` banner in the chat tab**. `src/App.tsx` listens for
  the Tauri event emitted by `crates/rezon-web/src/llm.rs::chat` (and
  `agent::commands::agent_chat`) when wikilink expansion finds
  unresolvable targets; renders as a dismissable yellow banner under
  the message list, clears automatically when the next message is
  sent.
- **`↶ Undo` button in NotesView** (`src/notes/NotesView.tsx`). Sits
  in the editor tab strip; flushes any pending debounced saves before
  invoking `vault_undo`, then refreshes the affected tab's
  `diskContent` + `liveContent` (or closes the tab if the file was
  deleted by the revert). Refreshes the file tree to pick up
  creates/deletes from the undo.
- **`vault-warning` toast in NotesView**. Tauri `vault_write` /
  `vault_undo` now emit `vault-warning` when the journal returns a git
  warning (e.g. pre-commit hook rejected the auto-commit) or fails
  outright. Frontend listens via `useEffect` and surfaces a
  dismissable warning-colored banner below the file editor's error
  banner.
- **Tests**:
  - `rezon-core` +12: `wikilink::scan_*`, `wikilink::expand_*`,
    `write_note::normalize_rel_*`, `write_note::render_preview_*`,
    `write_note::*_preview_*`, `journal::record_write_*`,
    `journal::ensure_gitignore_is_idempotent`,
    `journal::blob_dedup_on_identical_content`,
    `journal::last_undoable_*`, `journal::gc_*`,
    `journal::skip_git_sentinel_suppresses_commit`. Total: 53.

### Changed
- **Fresh conversation per launch**. After `Store::load_or_new`, if
  the active conversation has any user turns, the TUI pushes a new
  empty conversation and switches to it; the previous one stays in
  `store.conversations` and is reachable via `/conv`. Persisted
  immediately so a crash before the first turn doesn't re-resume the
  old conversation. Skip when the active conv is already empty so
  consecutive launches don't pile up blanks.
- **llama.cpp / ggml log noise muted**. `LlamaBackend::void_logs()`
  is called immediately after `LlamaBackend::init()` in
  `crates/rezon-core/src/llm.rs::ensure_backend`. The global no-op
  callback suppresses `ggml_metal_*`, `llama_model_loader:`,
  `print_info:`, `load_tensors:`, `llama_context:`,
  `llama_kv_cache:`, and `ggml_metal_library_compile_pipeline:`
  output. The TUI also emits `\x1b[2J\x1b[3J\x1b[H` immediately
  before `print_banner()` to wipe any stderr that beat `void_logs`,
  gated on `IsTerminal`.
- **Provider-precedence rule at TUI startup**. If `--provider` was
  left at the CLI default (`openrouter`), the stored
  `default_provider` from the setup wizard wins; an explicitly
  passed `--provider X` still overrides for the session.
  Local-model auto-load now also checks `cli.gguf`, then
  `cli.model` (if it ends in `.gguf`), then
  `read_last_model(<config_dir>)`.
- **`ConfirmationGate::ask` signature**. `async fn ask(&self, call:
  &ToolCall, preview: Option<&str>) -> ConfirmationOutcome`.
  `AutoApproveGate`, `TuiConfirmationGate`, `TauriConfirmationGate`
  updated; `UiEvent::Confirm` carries `preview: Option<String>` and
  `agent-tool-confirm` Tauri event carries `preview?: string`.
- **`StoreFile` schema**. New fields, all `#[serde(default)]` so
  existing stores migrate silently: `setup_complete: bool`,
  `models_dir: Option<String>`, `output_dir: Option<String>`,
  `default_provider: Option<String>`.
- **`store::config_dir()` is now `pub`** so the wizard and the
  agent-tool path can compute defaults relative to the same dir
  `Store` uses.

### Fixed
- **Crash on first-turn chat with a long conversation history**
  (`GGML_ASSERT(n_tokens_all <= cparams.n_batch) failed`).
  `crates/rezon-core/src/llm.rs::run_chat_with_cache` and
  `run_agent_with_cache` previously called `ctx.decode(&mut batch)`
  with the entire `to_add` slice in one go. With `n_batch = 2048`,
  any rendered prompt over ~2048 tokens (trivial for a 19-message
  history) tripped the assert and aborted the process. Both paths
  now chunk `to_add` into `ctx.n_batch()`-sized slices and decode
  each in turn; the `logits=true` flag is set only on the prompt's
  final token of the final chunk.
- **`/models` no longer asks for provider first** when called with
  no argument — defaults to the current effective provider (per the
  user's mental model of "show models for the thing I'm using now").
  Explicit `/models <key>` still works for browsing a different
  provider's catalog.
- **Hard error on `--provider local` without a GGUF path removed**.
  Startup-load failures are now soft: the REPL boots regardless,
  with a `note: provider is local but no model loaded — use /model to
  pick one` message. The user can pick via the `/model` picker and
  the model auto-loads.

- **`rezon-tui` crate** — sequential REPL chat shell over `rezon-core`,
  shipped as the `rezon-tui` binary. Uses plain stdin/stdout (no
  alternate-screen takeover) so terminal scrollback / copy-paste /
  piping all work. clap CLI mirrors the GUI's provider/model knobs:
  `--provider {local,openai,anthropic,openrouter,other}`, `--model`,
  `--gguf`, `--base-url`, `--api-key`, `--system`, `--agent`,
  `--max-steps`.
- **Slash-command surface** in `rezon-tui`: `/help`, `/exit`, `/new`,
  `/conv [n]`, `/next`, `/prev`, `/rename`, `/delete`, `/agent`,
  `/chat`, `/model`, `/provider`, `/max-steps`, `/system [text]`,
  `/load <gguf>`, `/history`, `/search <query>` (full-text search
  across all conversations, newest first, with cap), `/tools` /
  `/tools enable|disable <name>` (runtime tool gate; persists),
  `/clear`, `/vault [path|close]`, `/note <path>`, `/find <query>`
  (semantic when an embed model is loaded, FTS5 otherwise),
  `/embed [<gguf>]`.
- **Conversation persistence**: rezon-tui stores all conversations,
  the active conversation id, the active vault path, and disabled
  tools as JSON under
  `<ProjectDirs::config_dir>/conversations.json` (macOS:
  `~/Library/Application Support/com.rezon.rezon-tui/`).
- **rustyline line editor** with persistent history at
  `<config_dir>/history.txt` — arrow keys, Home/End, Ctrl-A/E, Ctrl-W,
  Ctrl-U/K, Ctrl-R reverse-search, ↑/↓ history. Tab completion for
  slash commands and (for path-taking verbs `/load`, `/embed`,
  `/vault`, `/note`) for filesystem paths.
- **Streaming UX**: tokens stream straight to stdout as they arrive.
  Cancellation via Ctrl-C during a stream (flips
  `LlmState`/`AgentRunHandle` cancel flags); second Ctrl-C
  force-exits. Ctrl-D on an empty line exits cleanly. Per-turn stats
  printed in magenta after each response:
  `[ Prompt: N tok | Generation: N tok @ N.N t/s ]`.
- **Agent mode in the TUI**: `--agent` / `/agent`. Tool calls render
  inline as `→ name` then `✓ name: {result}` or `✗ name: error`.
  Tool confirmations prompt inline (`approve tool X with args …
  [y/N] >`) and block the agent loop on a oneshot. `search_notes`
  registers automatically when a vault is open.
- **Agent tool turns persist for replay**: `core::llm::ChatMsg`
  extended with optional `tool_calls` + `tool_call_id` (both
  `#[serde(default)]`, backward-compatible with existing stores).
  After each agent run the spawn block snapshots the full
  `Vec<ChatMessage>` via `UiEvent::AgentHistory` and the REPL
  replaces the conversation's messages with the structured form, so
  subsequent agent runs (including across restarts) see the model's
  prior tool selections + results.
- **Vault + embeddings in the TUI**: opens via `/vault <path>`;
  auto-opened on next launch via the persisted `active_vault`.
  `/find` uses semantic search when an embed model is loaded, FTS5
  otherwise. `/embed <gguf>` loads a separate embedding model;
  catch-up loop indexes new chunks in the background.
- **Spinner** for long-running blocking loads (`/load`, `/embed`,
  startup `--gguf`). Braille frames at 80 ms via a tokio task;
  cursor hidden during spin, restored on stop; suppressed on
  non-tty.
- **Cross-platform color**: `anstyle` for style values, `anstream`
  for output. SGR codes stripped automatically when stdout isn't a
  tty (`rezon-tui --help | cat`); translated to Win32 console API
  calls on legacy Windows; `NO_COLOR` honored.
- **Makefile targets**: `build-tui`, `build-tui-release`,
  `run-tui ARGS="…"`, `run-tui-release ARGS="…"`.
- **Markdown rendering** for assistant responses in chat mode. Tokens
  still stream raw for live feedback; on stream end the REPL counts
  the rows the raw text occupied (terminal-width-aware), scrolls the
  cursor back with `\x1b[<n>A\r\x1b[J`, and re-emits the formatted
  version in place. Hand-rolled renderer (no extra deps) handles
  `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `inline code` ``, `#`/`##`/`###`
  headings, `-`/`*`/`1.` lists, `> blockquotes`, and triple-backtick
  fenced code blocks (dimmed, 2-col indent, optional language tag
  noted as `┄ lang`). Skipped when stdout isn't a tty (piped output
  keeps raw markdown) and in agent mode (where inline tool pills
  would be clobbered by the re-render).
- **Embedded fuzzy picker** (`crossterm` + `nucleo-matcher`, no
  alt-screen takeover). Renders below the current cursor, scrolls
  selection into view, cleans up on exit. Bound to:
  - `/conv` — fuzzy pick over conversation titles (the old plain
    listing moved to `/conv list`).
  - `/search [query]` — picker over every non-system / non-tool
    message across all conversations. Optional argument pre-seeds
    the filter. Enter switches to the picked conversation and
    prints the matched message in context.
  - `/tools enable` / `/tools disable` with no name argument —
    picker over the disabled / enabled subset respectively.
  Keys: typing filters, `↑/↓` move, `Enter` selects, `Esc` /
  `Ctrl-C` cancel.
- **Tests** — 58 across the workspace, `make test` green.
  - `rezon-core` (25): vault file ops + path-traversal rejection,
    `vault_resolve_wikilink` modes, list-tree filtering/sorting,
    `chunk_markdown` paragraph splitting + char-offset coverage,
    cloud catalog shape + `resolve_cloud_config` paths,
    `persist/read_last_model` roundtrip, `to_openai_messages`
    tool-role filtering + unknown-role rejection, `ChatMsg` /
    `ChatMessage` serde with optional tool_calls + tool_call_id,
    `ToolRegistry::register`/`get`/`without`/`openai_schemas`.
    `tempfile` added as a dev-dependency.
  - `rezon-tui` (33): markdown renderer (bold / italic edge-case
    guard / inline code / headings / lists / blockquotes / fenced
    code) + `count_rows` wrap-aware row math, `picker::truncate`
    incl. multi-byte chars + max ∈ {0,1}, `Conversation`
    auto-titling, `Store` save/reload roundtrip via on-disk JSON,
    `delete_active` index clamping, `chat_messages_to_msgs`
    role-preserving conversion, `build_agent_messages` replay
    (carries `tool_calls` on assistant turns + `tool_call_id` on
    tool turns; drops orphan tool turns).
- **Per-conversation settings** in `rezon-tui`. Each conversation
  carries optional overrides for `provider`, `model`, `base_url`,
  `api_key`, `agent_mode`, and `show_thinking`; the REPL composes
  effective values per call from `Conversation::settings` falling
  back to CLI defaults. `/model`, `/provider`, `/agent`, `/chat`
  now write to the active conversation (persisted) instead of the
  process. Switching conversations via `/conv` / `/next` / `/prev`
  automatically picks up the new conversation's settings.
- **`/thinking on|off|toggle`** — surface or hide agent reasoning
  blocks (`<think>` tokens emitted by Qwen3 and some Anthropic
  prompt-cache responses). Per-conversation; default off.
  `--show-thinking` CLI flag sets the launch default. Thinking
  deltas stream in dim mode and an inline `C_RESET` precedes the
  next content token so the assistant text isn't tinted.
- **`/history` markdown rendering** — prior assistant turns route
  through `markdown::render` so they show with the same bold /
  italic / heading / list / code-block formatting as live
  responses. System / tool / user lines unchanged.
- **`/clear`** intercepted before `handle_command` so it can call
  `editor.clear_screen()` on the local rustyline editor; the
  editor's internal layout tracking is reset alongside the visible
  viewport, so the next prompt aligns cleanly.
- **`/export <path>` / `/import <path>`** — single-conversation
  round-trip via pretty-printed JSON. Imports get a fresh id (via
  `store::next_id`, promoted to `pub(crate)`) so a re-imported file
  can coexist with the original. Tab completion treats the
  argument as a filesystem path.
- **`/fork`** — duplicate the active conversation. Fresh id, title
  becomes `"<title> (fork)"`, immediately switched to. Persists.
- **`/models [provider]`** — list a provider's recommended models
  (from `crates/rezon-core/models.json`). `*` marks the
  conversation's currently active model; `(default)` marks the
  catalog default. `local` is a special case that reports the
  loaded GGUF path. No-arg uses the active conversation's
  effective provider.
- **Live tokens-per-second in the terminal title** during
  generation. The REPL writes `\x1b]0;rezon · ~N.N tok/s\x07`
  throttled to ~5 Hz; rate is approximated from emitted char
  count / 4 (same heuristic the chat path uses when the provider
  omits usage). `Token` and `Thinking` deltas both feed the
  counter. On `Done` / `Error` the title resets to `rezon`.
  Suppressed when stdout isn't a tty.
- **`/conv` + `/conv list` disambiguation**: each entry now shows a
  cyan-meta `(N msgs · 2h ago)` suffix. `Conversation` gained
  `last_used: Option<u64>` (epoch ms) and a `touch()` helper called
  whenever a turn lands or an import / fork / new is created. The
  `/conv` picker sorts most-recently-used first while preserving
  the correct store index on selection.
- **FTS5-backed `/search`**: new module `conv_index.rs` (`ConvIndex`)
  opens a SQLite database at `<config_dir>/conversations.db` with a
  `conv_msgs(conv_id UNINDEXED, msg_idx UNINDEXED, role UNINDEXED,
  content, tokenize='porter unicode61')` virtual table. Rebuilt
  from the in-memory `Store` on launch; mutated in-place on every
  turn (`replace_conv`), `/delete` (`delete_conv`), `/import` /
  `/fork`. `cmd_search` translates the query into FTS5 syntax
  (`tok*` prefix matching for word tokens, `"phrase"` quoting for
  tokens with punctuation), and renders the matched snippet with
  FTS5's `<<` / `>>` highlights. Linear walk still backs the
  empty-query case and the index-unavailable fallback. Adds
  `rusqlite = "0.32" features = ["bundled"]` as a direct rezon-tui
  dep (matches rezon-core's version + features).
- **Conversation tests** (3 new in `rezon-tui::conv_index`):
  prefix vs phrase query construction, empty-query handling, and
  a full insert / search / delete roundtrip over a temp DB.
- **Markdown renderer expanded**: tables, links, strikethrough,
  HTML, escapes, and footnote refs all now render. Tables collapse
  into a box-glyph grid (`│ … │ … │` rows + `├─┼─┤` separator)
  with column widths computed from the widest cell. Links render
  as bright-blue anchor text followed by a dim `(url)`.
  Strikethrough renders with the SGR strikethrough modifier. Raw
  HTML (e.g. inline `<br>`) renders dim verbatim so it's visible
  but distinct.
- **Markdown renderer tests** (8 new in `rezon-tui::markdown`):
  mismatched `*`, backtick escape, stray backticks, links,
  `\*` escape, HTML pass-through, table grid, strikethrough.
- **`ReplHelper::complete` tests** (8 new in `rezon-tui::input`):
  empty line, `/` enumerates every command, prefix filters to
  matching verbs, caret-inside-verb completion, no-completion
  after non-path-taking verbs (`/exit foo`),
  `FilenameCompleter` delegation past a path-taking verb
  (`/load `), non-slash input yields nothing, plus a shared
  `with_ctx` helper that wires a `rustyline::Context` over an
  empty `DefaultHistory`.
  --workspace --all-targets -D warnings` clean. Lints fixed along
  the way:
  - `manual_flatten` in `core::search::vault_search_impl` — switched
    to `for hit in rows.flatten()`.
  - `only_used_in_recursion` in `core::vault::read_tree` — dropped
    the unused `vault: &Path` parameter from the recursive helper.
  - `collapsible_match` on the picker's Up/Down handlers — rewrote
    as match guards (`KeyCode::Up if state.selected > 0 =>`).
  - `items_after_test_module` in `tui::picker` — moved `cleanup`
    above the test module.
  - `missing_transmute_annotations` on
    `core::search::register_sqlite_vec` — `#[allow]` with a comment
    explaining the cast (both sides are `unsafe extern "C" fn`).
  - `too_many_arguments` on `tui::agent::spawn_agent_run` —
    `#[allow]`; collapsing into a struct would only push the
    bag-of-args one layer in.

### Changed
- **Workspace refactor.** Rust code split into a 3-crate Cargo
  workspace under `crates/`:
  - `rezon-core` — provider-agnostic backend: chat (local llama.cpp +
    OpenAI-compatible cloud via `async-openai`), agent loop, tools
    (including `search_notes`), vault file ops, FTS5 + sqlite-vec
    search index, embedding worker + background catch-up loop.
    Zero Tauri references.
  - `rezon-web` — thin Tauri shell wrapping `rezon-core` via
    `TauriChatSink`, `TauriEventSink`, `TauriConfirmationGate`,
    `#[tauri::command]` wrappers, and config-dir resolution. The
    frontend (`src/`) is untouched; all command names and event
    names preserved.
  - `rezon-tui` — terminal REPL described above.
- `src-tauri/` moved to `crates/rezon-web/`. `tauri.conf.json` got
  `frontendDist: "../../dist"`. The `make dev` / `make build`
  targets pass `--config $(TAURI_CONF)` so Tauri finds the
  relocated config; everything else (frontend, dev server, etc.)
  is unchanged.
- `LlmState`, `SearchState`, `EmbedState` are now registered as
  `Arc<T>` in Tauri's managed state so they can be shared between
  the chat command and the agent loop without copies.
- `ChatSink` trait introduced in `rezon-core::llm` to replace the
  previous direct `app.emit("chat-token"|"chat-stats"|"chat-done", …)`
  calls. `TauriChatSink` (in `rezon-web`) preserves the exact event
  names and payloads.
- `SearchState` now takes its data directory at construction
  (`SearchState::new(data_dir)`); the previous `Default` impl
  required an `AppHandle` to resolve `app_data_dir`. `rezon-web`
  builds it inside `.setup()` after the handle is available.
- `EmbedState::load` no longer emits Tauri events directly; the
  shell wrapper (`web::embed::do_load_embed`) emits
  `embed-loading` / `embed-loaded` / `embed-load-error` around the
  core call. `core::embed::ensure_catchup_started` takes
  `Arc<EmbedState>` + `Arc<SearchState>` instead of `AppHandle`.
- `core::llm::to_openai_messages` now skips `tool`-role messages
  (previously errored on unknown role) so a mixed agent/chat
  conversation history flows through the cloud chat endpoint
  cleanly. Same filter on the local chat path.
- `core::agent::tool::ToolContext` lost its
  `app: Option<AppHandle>` field. `agent::tools::search_notes`
  receives `Arc<SearchState>` + `Arc<EmbedState>` at construction
  (`register_search_notes(&mut reg, search, embed)`) instead of
  reaching for them through Tauri state.
- **README** — rewritten for the workspace layout. Now documents
  both shells (`rezon` GUI + `rezon-tui` REPL), describes the
  three-crate split with an annotated file tree, has separate
  Quick-start sections per shell, and lists all `make` targets
  including the new TUI ones. Build/run instructions for
  `rezon-tui` make clear it builds with `cargo` alone (no Bun /
  Tauri prerequisites).
- **`package.json`** — `tauri` npm script now bakes in
  `--config crates/rezon-web/tauri.conf.json` so
  `bun run tauri …` works standalone (no need to go through
  `make dev` / `make build`).
- **`docs/dev/*.md` paths** — 6 stale `src-tauri/` references
  rerouted to the workspace layout: `crates/rezon-web/examples/`
  for the spike + ReAct prototype + tool-calling runner;
  `crates/rezon-core/src/llm.rs` for the worker; the agent loop
  doc now shows the core / web split (provider-agnostic types in
  `crates/rezon-core/src/agent/`, Tauri command surface in
  `crates/rezon-web/src/agent/`).
- `SearchState::close_vault(path)` added in core so the TUI's
  `/vault close` actually drops the per-vault index + stops its
  file watcher (the GUI doesn't yet surface this).

### Fixed
- `make dev` / `make build` continue to work after the workspace
  refactor via the `--config $(TAURI_CONF)` flag passed to the
  Tauri CLI.
- **Markdown re-render row-count went stale on terminal resize.**
  `wait_for_turn` now captures `terminal_size()` into
  `stream_width: Option<u16>` on the first streamed `Token` and
  passes it into `rerender_markdown`. The visible rows were laid
  out against that width; re-reading the width at `Done` time
  after a mid-stream resize used to over- or under-clear and leak
  stale rows.
- **Spinner felt silent on multi-second loads.** `with_spinner`
  records start time and appends a dim `(Ns)` suffix to every
  frame so the user has a continuously-updating progress signal
  even when the underlying `spawn_blocking` work doesn't emit
  anything.
- **Markdown renderer mis-fires.** Swapped the hand-rolled
  state-machine parser for `pulldown-cmark` (default-features off;
  `ENABLE_TABLES`/`STRIKETHROUGH`/`TASKLISTS`/`FOOTNOTES`). Fixes:
  - `1 * 2 * 3` and similar arithmetic-looking prose no longer
    triggers spurious italic — CommonMark's flanking rules refuse
    the run.
  - Trailing/mismatched `*` and stray backticks pass through as
    literal characters instead of swallowing the rest of the line.
  - Backslash escapes (`\*`, `` \` ``, `\\`) now render as the
    intended literal character.
  - HTML and `[text](url)` are no longer rendered verbatim — they
    get distinct styles (dim for HTML, bright-blue text + dim
    URL for links).
  Public API (`render` / `count_rows`) is unchanged; the carried-
  over hand-roll tests still pass alongside the 8 new ones.

## [Older entries]

### Changed
- Migrated all headless-component usage from Radix
  (`@radix-ui/react-dialog`, `@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog`,
  `@radix-ui/react-tooltip`) to [Base UI](https://base-ui.com)
  (`@base-ui/react@1.4.1`), the consolidation effort by the same
  authors. Single dep, consistent API. Component name shifts:
  Radix `Overlay` → Base UI `Backdrop`; `Content` → `Popup`; Tooltip
  needs an extra `Positioner` wrapper between `Portal` and `Popup`.
  `Tooltip.Provider` props renamed (`delayDuration` →
  `delay`, `skipDelayDuration` → `timeout`). `Tooltip.Trigger` no
  longer needs `asChild` — it renders a `<button>` itself, so
  `className`/`onClick` go directly on the trigger.
- Provider and Theme native `<select>` elements replaced with Base UI
  `Select` for visual consistency with the rest of the
  themed/Base-UI-styled UI (no more OS-default chevron jumping out
  against the rest of the app). New shared wrapper at `src/Select.tsx`
  used by both the right-sidebar Provider field and the SettingsDrawer
  Theme field; takes `{ value, label }` items and a string
  `onValueChange`.
- Recommended-models field for cloud providers replaced the
  `<select>` + free-text `<input>` pair with a single Base UI
  `Combobox`. Typing filters the list; an explicit "No matches —
  press Enter to use as-is" empty state preserves the free-text
  override path. The Other-provider three-input stack
  (model + base URL + API key) is unchanged.
- Adopted Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite`. Component styling
  migrated from hand-rolled CSS classes (`rs-`, `conv-`, `msg-`, etc.)
  to Tailwind utility classes inline in JSX. The CSS-variables theming
  is preserved and surfaced as Tailwind color tokens via
  `@theme inline { --color-bg: var(--bg); ... }`, so utilities like
  `bg-bg` / `text-fg` / `border-border` automatically follow
  `[data-theme="..."]` switches without needing the `dark:` variant.
  `App.css` shrank to roughly: theme variables, markdown-content rules
  (`.md p`, `.md h1`...) that target generated HTML, code-block wrapper,
  and Radix `data-state` keyframes.

### Fixed
- AlertDialog / SettingsDrawer flashed in the top-left quadrant for one
  animation cycle before settling in the center after the Tailwind
  migration. Cause: Tailwind v4 centers via the modern `translate:`
  property (`-translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`), but the dialog
  pop-in/out keyframes wrote to the legacy `transform: translate(...)`.
  The two properties compose additively, double-translating the dialog
  off-center while the animation ran. Keyframes now animate only
  `scale` + `opacity`, leaving translation entirely to Tailwind.
- Crash on app close inside `__cxa_finalize` →
  `ggml_metal_device_free` →
  `GGML_ASSERT([rsets->data count] == 0) failed`. Cause: the worker
  thread refactor for KV-cache reuse stored only the `mpsc::Sender`
  in `LoadedHandle` and discarded the `JoinHandle`, so on
  `RunEvent::Exit` we'd close the channel and immediately return —
  the worker (and its `LlamaContext`) could still be alive when C++
  static destructors ran on the main thread, leaving live resource
  sets on the metal device. Fix: `LoadedHandle` now stores
  `Option<JoinHandle>` and its `Drop` impl closes the channel and
  joins the worker before returning. `LlmState::shutdown` also flips
  the cancel flag so an in-flight chat aborts immediately rather
  than running to `MAX_NEW_TOKENS`. Same join-on-drop also runs on
  model swap, so the previous model's worker is fully torn down
  before the new one takes over.

### Added
- Multiple conversations with a left sidebar. Conversations have their own
  title, system prompt, message history, and timestamps. Sorted most-recent
  first; rename inline (pencil icon) and delete (trash icon, confirms).
  All persisted to `localStorage` along with the currently selected
  conversation id; conversation titles are auto-derived from the first
  user message.
- Editable per-conversation system prompt in the right sidebar. New
  conversations seed from `settings.defaultSystemPrompt`.
- Settings drawer (Settings button in the sidebar) with theme
  (system/light/dark — applied via `data-theme` on `:root` and CSS
  variables), font size slider (12–20px, applied via root `font-size`),
  and default system prompt for new conversations. Persisted to
  `localStorage`.
- Copy buttons: per-message (revealed on row hover, copies the raw
  content) and per-code-block (revealed on `<pre>` hover, reads
  `pre.innerText` so it strips the highlight markup).
- Token / timing stats per assistant message. Backend emits a
  `chat-stats` event before `chat-done`:
  - Local: exact `promptTokens`, `cachedTokens`, `genTokens`, plus
    `durationMs` measured from the start of `run_chat_with_cache`.
  - Cloud: requests `stream_options.include_usage`; uses the final
    chunk's usage when present, otherwise falls back to a `len/4` char
    estimate so the row is never blank. Also includes `durationMs`.
  Rendered as a compact monospace line under each message:
  `1234 prompt (1100 cached) · 234 gen · 25.0 tok/s · 9.4s · local`.
- Better banner / error states. Load errors render in a dedicated banner
  with a dismiss button; chat errors render as a distinct error-styled
  assistant bubble (monospace, muted-red background) instead of mixing
  with normal markdown content.

### Changed
- Adopted Radix UI primitives for the bits where accessibility matters
  most: `@radix-ui/react-dialog` powers the SettingsDrawer (focus trap,
  ESC-to-close, scroll lock, portal, ARIA), `@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog`
  replaces the native `confirm()` on conversation delete, and
  `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` (wrapped in a top-level `Tooltip.Provider`)
  labels icon-only buttons (sidebar collapse/expand, "+" new chat in the
  collapsed left strip). The primitives are unstyled — CSS lives in
  `App.css` keyed off Radix's `data-state` attributes for fade/pop
  animations. No styling-framework migration: still vanilla CSS + CSS
  variables.
- Three-pane layout: left sidebar (conversations + settings), center
  (chat log + input), right sidebar (provider, model, system prompt).
  Both sidebars are collapsible (chevron toggle, persisted to settings);
  collapsed strips show only an expand button (left also keeps a "+"
  shortcut for new chat). Provider, model row, and the per-conversation
  system prompt textarea moved out of the chat header into a new
  `RightSidebar` component. Provider selection is now a single dropdown
  rather than a radio list.
- Frontend split into modules: `types.ts`, `storage.ts`, `Sidebar.tsx`,
  `RightSidebar.tsx`, `SettingsDrawer.tsx`, `MessageBody.tsx` (extracted
  from `App.tsx`). `App.tsx` is now an orchestrator wiring them together.
- The whole UI is themed via CSS variables (`--bg`, `--fg`, `--accent`,
  `--border`, `--code-bg`, etc.) — no more hard-coded `#4a7dff` /
  `rgba(127,127,127,...)` etc. scattered through `App.css`.

### Added (earlier in this Unreleased)
- KV cache reuse across turns for the local backend. Each loaded model now
  owns a dedicated worker thread that holds the `LlamaContext` and a
  shadow `Vec<LlamaToken>` of tokens currently in the KV cache. On each
  request the worker tokenizes the new full prompt, finds the longest
  common prefix with the cached tokens, calls `clear_kv_cache_seq` to
  truncate the KV cache to that point, and decodes only the divergent
  suffix before sampling. Continuing the same conversation now re-decodes
  ~zero prompt tokens instead of the full history.
- Stop button to abort an in-flight chat. New `cancel_chat` Tauri command
  flips an `AtomicBool` on `LlmState` that the local generation loop and
  the cloud stream loop both poll between iterations. The flag is reset
  at the start of each new `chat`. While streaming, the chat-input Send
  button is replaced by a red Stop button.

### Changed
- `LlmState.loaded` switched from `tokio::sync::Mutex<Option<Loaded>>` to
  `std::sync::Mutex<Option<LoadedHandle>>`. The handle holds the path and
  an `mpsc::Sender<WorkerRequest>` for the worker thread, which owns the
  model and context (`LlamaContext<'a>` is `<'a>`-tied to `LlamaModel` and
  not `Send`, so the only safe way to keep it alive between turns is to
  pin it to a single thread). `model_status` is now a sync command.
- Cloud providers via [`async-openai`](https://github.com/64bit/async-openai)
  0.36 (`chat-completion` feature). Four OpenAI-compatible providers ship
  out of the box. The first three are env-driven with hard-coded base URL,
  default model, and recommended-model list; the last is fully
  user-configurable:
  - **OpenAI** — `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `https://api.openai.com/v1`
  - **Anthropic** — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `https://api.anthropic.com/v1`
  - **OpenRouter** — `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
  - **Other** — user-configurable: model, base URL, and API key are
    entered in the UI and sent in `chat` opts. Intended for
    OpenAI-compatible servers like Ollama (`http://localhost:11434/v1`),
    LM Studio, or `llama.cpp` `server`. The API key is optional; an empty
    field is sent as `"no-key"` so servers that don't authenticate ignore
    it.
- Provider selector in the UI spans Local + the four cloud providers
  (later changed to a dropdown — see the [Unreleased] entry above).
  Named providers' cloud row shows a recommended-models dropdown alongside
  a free-text override (the text input is canonical and sent to the
  backend). The `other` row instead stacks three free-text inputs: model,
  base URL, API key (password field).
- New Tauri command `cloud_providers()` returns the static provider table
  plus per-provider `apiKeySet` and `userConfigurable`. Replaces
  `openai_available()`.
- `chat` command takes
  `opts: { provider, model?, baseUrl?, apiKey? }` (camelCase). `baseUrl`
  and `apiKey` are only consumed when the provider is user-configurable
  (i.e. `other`). **Breaking**: the previous `openaiModel` /
  `openaiBaseUrl` fields are gone — for the named providers, base URL is
  hard-coded.
- All cloud providers stream deltas through the same `chat-token` /
  `chat-done` events as the local backend.
- Markdown rendering for assistant messages via `react-markdown` with
  `remark-gfm`.
- KaTeX math rendering (`remark-math` + `rehype-katex`), including
  normalization of `\(...\)` and `\[...\]` LaTeX delimiters to `$...$` /
  `$$...$$` so they are picked up by `remark-math`. Skips fenced code blocks.
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks via `rehype-highlight` (highlight.js
  github-dark theme).
- Auto-close of unbalanced fenced code blocks during streaming so partial
  responses render correctly.

### Changed
- `package.json` gained `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`, `remark-math`,
  `rehype-katex`, `rehype-highlight`, `katex`, `highlight.js`.

## [0.1.0] - initial

### Added
- Tauri 2 + React 19 + Vite scaffold.
- Rust backend in `src-tauri/src/llm.rs` wrapping `llama-cpp-2` 0.1.146 with
  the `metal` feature.
- `LlmState` holding `LlamaBackend` and the currently loaded `LlamaModel`,
  with explicit `shutdown()` on `RunEvent::Exit` to drop the model before
  the backend and avoid ggml-metal static-destructor races.
- Tauri commands: `load_model`, `model_status`, `chat`.
- Frontend events: `model-loading`, `model-loaded`, `model-load-error`,
  `chat-token`, `chat-done`.
- Persistence of the last-loaded model path under the app config dir
  (`last_model.txt`) and auto-load on startup.
- Streaming token generation: prompt is tokenized, decoded once, then
  sampled token-by-token (`temp(0.7)` -> `dist(1234)`) up to `MAX_NEW_TOKENS`
  or EOG, with each piece emitted as a `chat-token` event.
- UTF-8 incremental decoder (`encoding_rs`) so multi-byte tokens aren't
  truncated mid-codepoint.
- Use of model-embedded chat template via `model.chat_template(None)` +
  `apply_chat_template`.
- React UI: model path input, file picker (`@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog`,
  `.gguf` filter), Load button, chat log with role labels, textarea input
  with Enter-to-send / Shift+Enter for newline, auto-scroll on new content.
- `Makefile` with `install`, `dev`, `build`, `web-dev`, `web-build`,
  `check`, `fmt`, `fmt-check`, `lint`, `test`, `clean` targets.
- MIT `LICENSE`.
