# TODO

Known gaps and ideas, roughly ordered by usefulness. Not committed scope.

## Inference / backend

- [ ] Cloud: forward sampling params (temperature, top_p, max_tokens) from
      the UI instead of using API defaults.
- [ ] Cloud: surface non-stream errors with HTTP status / body, not just
      `format!("{e}")`.
- [x] Persist provider choice + per-provider chosen model across restarts.
- [ ] User-overridable cloud-models config at
      `~/Library/Application Support/<app>/cloud-models.json`, layering
      on top of the build-time `src-tauri/models.json` when present.
- [ ] Save the API key entered for the `other` provider (currently it
      lives only in React state and is lost on app restart). Likely
      destination: OS keychain.
- [ ] Re-check API-key env vars per request rather than only at app
      launch, so users don't have to relaunch after exporting a key
      (`cloud_providers()` only snapshots availability at call time).
- [ ] Load API keys from a `.env` file via
      [`dotenvy`](https://crates.io/crates/dotenvy). For `tauri dev`,
      call `dotenvy::dotenv().ok()` early in `lib.rs::run()`. For
      packaged builds, resolve a path under the app config dir
      (`dotenvy::from_path(...)`) since the cwd isn't predictable.
- [ ] Configurable sampler: temperature, top-p, top-k, repeat penalty, seed
      (currently hard-coded `temp(0.7)` + `dist(1234)`).
- [ ] Configurable `n_ctx`, `max_new_tokens`, `n_gpu_layers` (currently
      hard-coded constants in `llm.rs`).
- [ ] Surface load progress / mmap status; `model-loading` only carries the
      path.
- [ ] UI affordance to unload the current local model (swap already works:
      `do_load` drops the previous `LoadedHandle` which closes the
      channel + joins the worker thread).
- [ ] Graceful error when the model has no embedded chat-template metadata
      (today it just bubbles up as a string).
- [ ] Handle prompts that overflow `n_ctx` (truncate history vs. error).
      Now that the KV cache persists across turns, a sliding-window
      eviction (drop oldest non-system tokens via `clear_kv_cache_seq` +
      `kv_cache_seq_add`) is more useful than just erroring.
- [ ] Non-macOS build paths (CUDA / CPU-only feature flags).

## Frontend / UX

- [ ] Search across conversations.
- [ ] Export / import conversations as JSON.
- [ ] Edit / regenerate a previous user message (truncate the conversation
      to that point and re-send).
- [ ] Sidebars: drag to resize (collapse already implemented).
- [ ] Pretty timestamps under each message.

## Tools / agent

- [ ] **`file_read` path sandboxing.** Today the user is the only gate
      (per-call confirmation). Add a `Settings.fileReadRoot` (or an
      allow-list of roots) that the tool checks before reading; reject
      paths outside. Default empty = current behavior.
- [ ] **`web_fetch` domain allow/blocklist.** Same posture: confirmation
      is the gate today. Add a `Settings.webFetchAllowedHosts` /
      `webFetchBlockedHosts` so power users can pin the tool to a
      specific set of sites without re-confirming each call.
- [ ] **Stream large `web_fetch` bodies.** Whole body is buffered before
      truncation. Fine at the 1 MiB cap; would need rework if the cap
      is ever raised significantly. Use `Response::bytes_stream()` and
      stop at `MAX_BYTES`.
- [ ] **"Remember per session" on the confirmation dialog.** Current
      "Ask" prompts on every call. Add a checkbox in the confirm dialog:
      "Always allow `web_fetch` for this conversation". Stores in a
      conversation-scoped trust map (not persisted across sessions).
- [ ] **Trust toggles persisted across sessions.** Same shape as above
      but persisted; surface a "Revoke" button somewhere. Higher-stakes;
      worth waiting until the threat model is clearer.
- [ ] **`shell_exec` improvements.** Today: spawn one command, capture
      stdout/stderr, enforce timeout (kills child on overrun) and per-
      stream output cap, optional `cwd`. Future: stdin piping, env-var
      allow-list, mid-run cancel via the agent loop's cancel flag.
- [ ] **Per-conversation tool sets.** Decision #2 was "all tools always
      available". If users start asking for "research mode" vs "code
      mode", revisit.
- [ ] **Show reasoning toggle.** Qwen 3's `<think>` blocks are dropped on
      the floor today (per design decision #4 the indicator is the
      streaming spinner). Add a collapsible "Show reasoning" affordance
      under each assistant bubble that did emit thinking deltas.
- [ ] **Truncate large tool results when persisting to localStorage.**
      The design said to do this; current code stores the full string.
      Risk: a large `web_fetch` body in conversation history can blow
      past the localStorage quota.

## Engineering

- [ ] Actual Rust tests (`make test` runs `cargo test` but `llm.rs` has none).
      In particular: a regression test that loading + dropping a model
      releases the metal device cleanly (the
      `GGML_ASSERT([rsets->data count] == 0)` crash that bit us on close).
      Probably needs a tiny GGUF fixture and a dedicated thread to host
      `LlamaContext`.
- [ ] Frontend tests / typecheck in CI.
- [ ] CI workflow (fmt-check, clippy, cargo test, vite build).
- [ ] Replace `eprintln!` with structured logging (`tracing`).
- [ ] Audit `unwrap()` on the std `Mutex` in `LlmState` for poisoning.
- [ ] Consider a typed event payload for `chat-token` instead of bare string
      (e.g. include a turn id so late events can't bleed into a new turn).
